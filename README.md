Since I am the only member of my group, I tackled everything in this project myself. The search for good data was much more challenging
that I originally anticipated. I believe if I managed my time a little better, the process would have went a lot smoother. Regardless,
I believe I produced a well thought-out and insightful project for the viewer.
